# Attendance Risk Calculator

A simple, mobile-optimized web tool that helps you understand how close you are to triggering additional attendance warnings based on a typical workplace policy (3 occurrences = 1 warning, 4 warnings = termination threshold).

This tool is designed for **personal reference and education only** and works great on smartphones.

# How It Works

The calculator uses these assumptions:

- Each unscheduled call-out that counts as an occurrence = **1 occurrence**
- Every **3 occurrences = 1 attendance warning**
- Warnings remain active for **6 months**
- The **4th active attendance warning** is commonly considered a termination threshold

The tool provides **mathematical estimates only**; it does not represent an official HR interpretation.
